      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 06, 2025</p>
      <p>
        ShapeHaven Innovations LLC (“ShapeHaven,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) operates
        one or more mobile applications (each an “App”). We respect your privacy
        and are committed to protecting any data handled in connection with your
        use of our App(s). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
        disclose, and safeguard your information, including details required by
        Apple and additional language for third-party advertising.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Scope &amp; Applicability</h3>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to data collected or processed directly by
        ShapeHaven Innovations LLC in connection with your use of any of our
        App(s). By installing or using our App(s), you agree to the terms of
        this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h3>2. No Personal Data Collection by ShapeHaven</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>User-Generated Content &amp; Preferences:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any presets, configuration settings, or histories you create
              within the App are stored locally on your device (e.g., using
              Apple’s UserDefaults or local file storage).
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not transmit that content or those settings to any external
              server.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device &amp; Usage Data (Technical Only):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To keep the App functional and up-to-date, Apple’s iOS system may
              record basic diagnostic data or crash logs (if you have enabled
              diagnostics &amp; usage sharing). ShapeHaven does not access or
              view those logs—Apple’s diagnostics infrastructure alone handles
              them.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not embed any third-party analytics, metrics, or monitoring
              frameworks (e.g., Firebase, Google Analytics).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. In-App Purchases &amp; Payment Processing</h3>
      <p>
        Our App(s) may offer an auto-renewable subscription or other in-app
        purchases for premium features or content. All billing and payment
        processing is handled exclusively by Apple through the App Store. We
        never see, store, or manage your credit card or billing information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Apple’s Transaction Data:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you make a purchase or renew a subscription, Apple’s systems
          collect information necessary to complete the transaction (e.g., your
          Apple ID, purchase receipt, billing country).
        </li>
        <li>
          ShapeHaven only receives confirmation from Apple that a valid purchase
          or subscription exists; we do not receive any of your payment details.
        </li>
        <li>
          For details on how Apple handles your purchase data—what they collect,
          how they retain it, and how long they keep it—refer to Apple’s Privacy
          Policy:
          <a
            href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/resources/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"

            https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/resources/
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Data Retention &amp; Server Information</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>ShapeHaven’s Servers:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Data Location: We do not operate any backend servers for our
              App(s), and no user-identifiable data is ever transmitted off your
              device.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data Retention: Since all user-generated data remains on your
              device, ShapeHaven has no server-side retention obligations.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Apple’s Servers (for Purchases):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Apple retains purchase receipts and basic purchase metadata on
              secure servers.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can review or request deletion of that purchase data via your
              Apple ID account settings.
            </li>
            <li>
              For details on Apple’s data retention policies, see Apple’s
              Privacy Policy:
              <a
                href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/resources/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"
              >
                https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/resources/
              </a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>5. Third-Party Services &amp; Links</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>App Store (Apple) Services:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The App Store handles our App(s) distribution, updates, purchase
          validation, and (if you’ve opted in) crash-reporting diagnostics. Any
          analytics or crash logs generated by Apple’s operating system or by
          TestFlight (in the case of beta testing) are governed by Apple’s
          Privacy Policy. ShapeHaven does not access those logs directly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>External URLs:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If our App includes links to external websites (e.g., for support,
          documentation, or Terms of Use), those sites may collect information
          according to their own policies. Always review the privacy statements
          of any third-party website before providing personal data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.1 Third-Party Advertising &amp; Analytics (AdMob)</h3>
      <p>
        If we integrate Google AdMob (or any other ad network) in the future,
        that SDK may collect certain device and usage data for personalized ads
        and analytics. This includes, but is not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> e.g. IDFA (Identifier for
          Advertisers), device advertising settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>App Usage Events:</strong> e.g. which screens you view, how
          long you stay, ad impressions and clicks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location Data:</strong> if you grant location permission at
          the system level.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Google/AdMob uses this information to serve targeted advertisements,
        measure ad performance, and improve its services. For details about how
        Google collects, uses, and shares your information when you use apps
        with Google services, see:
        <a
          href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
        >
          https://policies.google.com/privacy
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>You can opt out of personalized ads by:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Going to Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Tracking on your iPhone
          or iPad and toggling off “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” or
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjusting your device’s Limit Ad Tracking setting under Settings →
          Privacy &amp; Security → Apple Advertising, or
        </li>
        <li>
          Visiting Google’s Ads Settings page:
          <a
            href="https://adssettings.google.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
          >
            https://adssettings.google.com/
          </a>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Disabling “Allow Apps to Request to Track” or “Limit Ad Tracking” will
        not prevent you from seeing ads, but they will be less relevant.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Children’s Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Our App(s) are not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do
        not collect any personal data from children under 13. If you believe a
        child under 13 has inadvertently provided any personal information
        through our App(s), please delete the App from the device.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Your Rights &amp; Choices</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Local Data Management:</strong><br />
          Because user-generated data (presets, histories, etc.) is stored on
          your device, you may delete the App or clear its data at any time via
          Settings → General → iPhone Storage → App Name → Delete App. That
          action erases all local data for that App.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Opting Out of Diagnostics Sharing:</strong><br />
          To prevent Apple from sending diagnostic &amp; usage data related to
          our App(s) to Apple, go to Settings → Privacy &amp; Security →
          Analytics &amp; Improvements and toggle off “Share iPhone Analytics”
          or “Share App Analytics.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In-App Purchases Management:</strong><br />
          You can manage, cancel, or modify any subscription at any time via
          Settings → Subscriptions → App Name. Apple’s system will handle the
          rest.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>8. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time (for example, if
        Apple introduces new requirements or if we add features that collect
        data). When we do, we will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Update the “Last updated” date at the top.</li>
        <li>
          Post the revised Privacy Policy within our App(s) (e.g., in a
          “Settings → Privacy Policy” screen) and on our website (if one
          exists).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Continued use of
        our App(s) after changes are posted indicates your acceptance of the
        updated Privacy Policy.
      </p>
