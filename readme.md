| Section            | Purpose                                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.html`       | Landing page highlighting our flagship SDKs and components.                      |
| `images/`          | Optimised PNG/SVG assets used by the site.                                       |
| `CNAME`            | Binds the custom domain **shapehaveninnovations.org** to this GitHub Pages site. |
| `docs/` (optional) | Long-form documentation & release notes (added as needed).                       |

Everything is plain **HTML + CSS** (no server-side code), so you can clone and view locally without additional tooling.
