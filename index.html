      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025, June 06</p>
      <p>
        ShapeHaven Innovations LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy
        and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy
        describes how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information
        when you install and use our mobile application (the “App”). Please read
        this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this
        Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Information You Provide</strong>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <strong>Registration &amp; Onboarding Data:</strong> When you
              first launch the App, you may be asked to provide certain personal
              information (e.g., name, email address) to create an account or
              complete onboarding.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User‐Generated Content:</strong> Any information you
              voluntarily submit in forms, surveys, or feedback features (e.g.,
              workout names, intentions, saved presets) will be stored locally
              and/or on our servers.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automatically Collected Data</strong>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <strong>Device &amp; Usage Data:</strong> We may automatically
              collect information about your device (e.g., device model,
              operating system version, unique device identifiers) and how you
              use the App (e.g., session times, features accessed, crash logs).
              This helps us improve performance and troubleshoot issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Analytics:</strong> We use third‐party analytics tools
              (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Google Analytics for Firebase, or
              Apple’s App Analytics) to collect anonymized usage data (e.g.,
              number of active users, screen views, button taps). These
              analytics systems may use cookies or similar technologies to
              collect data about your use of the App.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In‐App Purchases</strong>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <strong>Subscription &amp; Purchase Data:</strong> When you make
              an in‐app purchase (subscription or one‐time), Apple processes the
              transaction and provides us with a transaction receipt (no credit
              card information). We may store non‐identifying purchase receipts
              to verify your subscription status.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>To Provide &amp; Maintain the App</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Authenticate and identify you for subscription checks.</li>
            <li>
              Enable core features (saving workout presets, tracking history,
              analytics, etc.).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To Improve &amp; Develop New Features</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Analyze usage patterns (e.g., most used features, crash logs) to
              make the App more reliable and responsive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Customize your user experience (e.g., show relevant
              recommendations, adjust onboarding flow).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To Communicate with You</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Send transactional messages (e.g., subscription renewal
              notifications, password resets).
            </li>
            <li>Respond to your inquiries, support requests, or feedback.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>For Marketing &amp; Advertising (Optional)</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you opt in, we may send promotional emails about new features
              or offers.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not share your personal email address with third‐party
              advertisers without your explicit consent.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
      <p>
        We will not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. We may
        share information in the following circumstances:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Providers</strong><br />
          We engage trusted third‐party vendors (e.g., hosting providers,
          analytics services, crash reporters) to perform data processing on our
          behalf. They are contractually bound to keep your data confidential
          and use it only to provide services to us.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Requirements</strong><br />
          When required by law or in response to valid legal requests (e.g.,
          subpoenas, court orders), we may disclose your information to comply
          with legal obligations or protect our rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business Transfers</strong><br />
          In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, user data
          may be transferred to the new owner. We will notify you before your
          personal data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>4. Data Storage, Security &amp; Retention</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Storage Location:</strong><br />
          All data is stored on secure servers in [Country/Region], and/or
          encrypted locally on your device via Apple’s Keychain and file‐
          protection APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security Measures:</strong><br />
          We employ industry‐standard security measures (TLS encryption in
          transit, AES‐256 encryption at rest where applicable) to protect your
          data. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or
          electronic storage is 100% secure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Retention:</strong><br />
          We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the
          purposes outlined in this Policy (e.g., to maintain your account,
          verify subscription status, enforce our terms). Usage analytics and
          crash logs are retained for up to [X] months for improvement and
          troubleshooting. If you delete your account, we will remove associated
          personal data from our active systems within [Y] days, except where
          law requires otherwise.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>5. Your Rights &amp; Choices</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Access &amp; Correction:</strong><br />
          You may review or update your account information (e.g., email, name)
          by logging into the App and accessing “Settings.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Opt‐Out of Marketing:</strong><br />

          unsubscribe link in our emails or contacting us at
          <a href="mailto:support@shapehaveninnovations.com"
            >support@shapehaveninnovations.com</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Apple Privacy Controls:</strong><br />
          You can control permissions (e.g., notifications, analytics sharing)
          in Settings → Privacy &amp; Security on your iPhone or iPad. For App
          Analytics data collection, go to Settings → Privacy &amp; Security →
          Analytics &amp; Improvements and toggle off “Share iPhone &amp; Watch
          Analytics” or “Share With App Developers.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Delete Your Data:</strong><br />
          To request deletion of all personal data associated with your account,
          email us at

          any legal obligations.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>6. Children’s Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you
        become aware that a child has provided us with personal information,
        please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@shapehaveninnovations.com"

      </p>

      <h3>7. Third‐Party Links &amp; Services</h3>
      <p>
        Our App may contain links to third‐party websites, products, or services
        (e.g., to view privacy policies of analytics providers). This Privacy
        Policy does not apply to those third‐party services—you should review
        their privacy policies separately before providing any personal data.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make
        material changes, we will notify you within the App (e.g., via an in‐App
        banner) and update the “Last updated” date at the top. Your continued
        use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of those
        changes.
