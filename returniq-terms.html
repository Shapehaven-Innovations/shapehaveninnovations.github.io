    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of ReturnIQ, a Shopify application operated by ShapeHaven Innovations LLC ("ShapeHaven," "we," "us," or "our"). By installing or using ReturnIQ ("Service"), you ("Merchant," "you," or "your") agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

      <li>Analyzes return patterns using artificial intelligence to identify root causes.</li>
      <li>Provides risk scores, actionable recommendations, and AI-generated product descriptions.</li>
      <li>Displays analytics through an interactive dashboard within the Shopify admin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Account &amp; Installation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must have an active Shopify store to use ReturnIQ.</li>
      <li>By installing ReturnIQ, you authorize us to access the Shopify API scopes requested during installation (products, orders, customers).</li>
      <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Shopify account. We are not liable for unauthorized access resulting from compromised Shopify credentials.</li>
      <li>You may uninstall ReturnIQ at any time through your Shopify admin. Uninstalling will cancel any active subscription and trigger data deletion per our Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscription Plans &amp; Billing</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Plans</h3>

    </ul>

    <h3>3.3 Refunds</h3>
